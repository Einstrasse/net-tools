                Information about the net-tools package                                
NET-TOOLS	A collection of programs that form the base set of the
		NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating
		system.

This package includes the important tools for controlling the network
subsystem of the Linux kernel.  This includes arp, hostname, ifconfig,
netstat, rarp and route.

Please include the output of "program --version" when reporting bugs.

                          Notes
                          -----

This is net-tools 1.432.  You need kernel 2.0 or later to use these programs.
These programs should compile cleanly with either glibc or libc5.

There is no NLS support in this distribution.  The files are out of date.
Unless a volunteer is found soon to maintain the translations, NLS will be
dropped altogether.

ipfw has been removed from the distribution.  Use ipfwadm instead; get
it at <ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/>.

route/netstat -r do not yet support different AF cleanly.  IPX/DDP/AX25
people, please feel free to add the code.

ifconfig now supports changing media types for interfaces.  This requires
a recent 2.1.x kernel, and many devices do not support it yet.

The documentation is slimmed down.  I think most of it was out of
date.
