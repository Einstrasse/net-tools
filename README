                Information about the net-tools package                                
NET-TOOLS	A collection of programs that form the base set of the
		NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating
		system.

This package includes the important tools for controlling the network
subsystem of the Linux kernel.  This includes arp, hostname, ifconfig,
netstat, rarp and route.

Please include the output of "program --version" when reporting bugs.

                          Notes
                          -----

This is a snapshot net-tools release, which by definition is not well
tested.  Be prepared for bugs and strange behaviour.  The next release
of net-tools should be 1.5.

You need kernel 2.0 or later to use these programs.  These programs
should compile cleanly with either glibc or libc5.

The NLS support was changed from catgets to GNU gettext by Arnaldo
Carvalho de Melo <acme@conectiva.com.br> in June, 1998, to make the
source more readable. A translation to brazilian portuguese (pt_BR) is
available and others are welcome!

If your system has no support for GNU gettext then `make install' will
probably fail in the po directory.  This is harmless and can be ignored;
all the tools and manual pages are already installed at this point.

ipfw has been removed from the distribution.  Use ipfwadm instead; get
it at <ftp://ftp.xos.nl/pub/linux/ipfwadm/>.

route/netstat -r do not yet support different AF cleanly.  IPX/DDP/AX25
people, please feel free to add the code.

ifconfig now supports changing media types for interfaces.  This requires
a recent 2.1.x kernel, and many devices do not support it yet.

The documentation is slimmed down.  I think most of it was out of
date.

Some configuration options require recent 2.1.x kernels.  The defaults should
be safe for both 2.0 and 2.1.  Some of this code may also have problems with
glibc 2.0.
